# Image-Classifier-Project-Udacity
2nd project of Udacity Introduction to Machine Learning Nanodegree

In this project, we train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice we train this classifier, then export it for use in an application. We are using this dataset from Oxford of 102 flower categories.

We include several files: the notebook for the first part of the project - creating the model, and the model itself, the python script for the second part of the project - application to use the model, a map file showing the names of the flowers, and the licence file for the Oxford data we use.
